			"description": "Acidify is a wrapper for a number of scripts that compose the Android build system. It's purpose is to provide convenience for people building multiple versions of Android (such as CyanogenMod maintainers). It's original purpose was to make it easy for members of TeamAcid to switch between CyanogenMod versions with one command. It also provides a method for installing all the required packages needed for building Android (if using Ubuntu or Linux Mint), including CyanogenMod 7, 9, and the Android Open Kang Project. In addition, it supports local manifests, provides a function for deploying built OTA zips to the device, and uploading ready builds to Goo.im. The script is written in bash and is easily configurable.<br /><br />I'm beginning to rewrite the script in Python to make it more versatile, add a number of missing features, and overcome some of the limitations of what can be done in bash.",
